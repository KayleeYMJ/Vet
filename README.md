It's a simple Angular application and the supporting .NET
Core Web API layer required to provide a page to
search for appointments and display a summary of search results.

Fuctions:
Search for appointments by: Date and/or Pet Name. Allow for a search all if no criteria is selected.
For search results, display the appointment date/time, pet name, ownerâ€™s name, and preferred
contact details.
Search results should be ordered by date/time.
UI should be responsive for screen resolution, I.e. compatible with mobile devices.
Data should support paging with 10, 20, 50, or 100 items per page with 10 being the default.
